# Position-vs-salary-R-NonLinearRegression
This repository contains various machine learning regression models, built in R, to predict a salary for a given level of employee. as the data is non-linear, the regression techniques used have generated different results. Graphs obtained in various models are attached.
Given a situation that salary of an employee has to be predicted by the level he's been working at, the dataset shows non linear trend, therefore in the codes I've compared the regression results of different non-linear techniques within themselves as well as to the non linear regression model. The different Non Linear techniques shown here are:

Polynomial Regression
Support Vector Regression
Decision Tree Regression
Random Forest Regression
